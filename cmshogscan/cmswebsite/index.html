  <h1>HOG[SCAN] (CMS) Setup Notes</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Assignable Roles</h2>
    <p><i>HOG[SCAN]</i> uses "role based permissions" to restrict network access based on a members role within the HOG chapter. This allows you, the webmaster, to control what roles each officer, primary and discretionary, has to the different levels of the system. For example, not every primary officer wants, or needs, the Primary Officer role.</p>
    <p>Remember, you have a sandbox (dev) environment to work/test in. Make changes and try things in that environment first. It is easier to undo errors there than it is in your production environment.
      <span class="newline">Login credentials are the same for both environments</span>
      <span class="newline">It's helpful to create a dummy user. You can assign different roles to this user and login to see what a user with each role can/cannot do.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Roles on this page are listed by permissions, highest to lowest.</p>
    <p>Please note that the Webmaster, Primary Officer and Membership Officer roles have access to member information. Assign these roles with caution.</p>

    <h2>Directories</h2>
    <p>Use the read/write access to directories to your advantage. Do not just dump files or images into a directory. Rather, create subdirectories as needed.
      <span class="newline">For example, in the <code>activities</code> directory you can create one subdirectory to place images for destination rides and another subdirectory for images for dealer events. It's clear to you, and to others, what the different directories are for.</span>
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the aforementioned directories, each assignable role also has read/write permission to a <code>users</code> directory. This directory is unique to each person, even those that share the same role cannot see another's user directory.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Event Calendar Notes</h2>
    <p>While we want as many people as possible to attend and enjoy our events there is a difference between an "open" event and a "closed" event. Be sure you understand the difference and mark events appropriately.</p>
    <p>Check with your HOG Regional Manager for clarification but the big difference between the two is liability. For your HOG Chapter the majority of events are "closed" events. This means that 51% of the participants need to be local chapter members. If this is not true, the event can still take place but it is no longer considered a chapter event.</p>
    <p>In order for an event to be considered an "open" event additional insurance is needed. The chapter needs to apply for this a few weeks in advance of the event and it needs to be approved.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Team member - Primary Officer versus Chapter Officer versus Road Captain</h2>
    <p>There are three different pages that show the Primary Officers, Chapter Officers and Road Captains. The four Primary Officers display on the Home page. Chapter Officers and Road Captains each have pages in the About Us menu.
      <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
        A member may have a dual role. That is, in addition to being a Primary Officer or a Chapter Officer they may be a Primary Officer AND a Road Captain or a Chapter Officer AND a Road Captain. When you 'Create Team Member' for someone that has dual roles be sure and keep the roles separate. That means you will add that team member twice. Once where you'll check the box if they are a Primary Officer or Chapter Officer and the second time where you check the box for the Road Captain role.</span>
      <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
        This will help when ordering the Chapter Officers and Road Captains pages. For instance, when viewing the Chapter Officers I assign a weight to each of the officers to order how each one is displayed.
      </span>
      <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
        In a similar way on the Road Captains page, I want the Safety Officer and Head Road Captain to display first so they are assigned higher weights. I then assign a weight to each of the remaining Road Captains so they are listed alphabetically.
      </span>

    <h2>Creating a Basic Page</h2>
    <p>Be aware that when creating a basic page, by default, non-authenticated users can view the page
      <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
        If the page you are creating should only been seen by authenticated users, a best-practice is to give the page a Title, provide a menu link and then Save the page. You can then go to the page and click the 'Access control' tab to configure the access control settings for the page. Submit the settings to save them prior to editing the page and filling in the content.
