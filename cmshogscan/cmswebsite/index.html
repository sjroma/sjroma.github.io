  <h1>HOG[SCAN] (CMS) Setup Notes</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Assignable Roles</h2>
    <p>HOG[SCAN] uses "role based permissions" which restricts network access based on each members role within your HOG chapter. This allows you, the webmaster, to control what roles each officer and member has to the different levels of the system. For example, not every primary officer wants, or needs, the Primary Officer role.</p>
    <p>Remember, you have a sandbox (dev) environment to work/test in. Make changes and try things in that environment first. It is easier to undo errors there than it is in your production environment.</p>
    <p>Roles on this page are listed by permissions, highest to lowest.</p>
    <p>Please note that the Webmaster, Primary Officer and Membership Officer roles have access to member information. Assign these roles with caution.</p>

    <h2>Directories</h2>
    <p>In addition to the aforementioned directories, each assignable role also has read/write permission to a <code>users</code> directory. This directory is unique to each person, even those that share the same role cannot see another's user directory.</p>
    <p>Use the read/write access to directories to your advantage. Do not just dump files or images into a directory. Rather, create subdirectories as needed. For example, in the <code>activities</code> directory you can create a subdirectory to place images for destination rides and another subdirectory for images for dealer events. It's clear to you, and to others, what the different directories are for.</p>

    <h2>Event Notes</h2>
    <p>While we want as many people as possible to attend and enjoy our events there is a difference between an "open" event and a "closed" event. Be sure you understand the difference and mark your events appropriately.</p>
    <p>Check with your HOG Regional Manager for clarification but the big difference between the two is liability. For your HOG Chapter the majority of events are "closed" events. This means that 51% of the participants need to be local chapter members. If this is not true, the event can still take place but it is no longer considered a chapter event.</p>
    <p>In order for an event to be considered an "open" event additional insurance is needed. The chapter needs to apply for this a few weeks in advance of the event and it needs to be approved.</p>
