    <section>
      <h2 id="assign">Assignable Roles</h2>
      <p><i>HOG[SCAN]</i> uses "role based permissions" to restrict network access based on a members role within the HOG chapter. This allows you, the webmaster, to control what roles each officer, primary and discretionary, has to the different levels of the system. For example, not every primary officer wants, or needs, the Primary Officer role.</p>
      <p>Remember, you have a sandbox (dev) environment to work/test in. Make changes and try things in that environment first. It is easier to undo errors there than it is in your production environment.
        <span class="newline">Login credentials are the same for both environments</span>
        <span class="newline">It's helpful to create a dummy user. You can assign different roles to this user, then login to see what that role can/cannot do.</span>
      </p>
      <p>Roles on this page are listed by permissions, highest to lowest.</p>
      <p>Please note that the Webmaster, Primary Officer and Membership Officer roles have access to member information. Assign these roles with caution.</p>

      <h2>Production vs Sandbox</h2>
      <p>Remember that there are two environments that you, the webmaster, and any Chapter Officer that has an <a class=anchor-link href="#assign">assignable role</a> can work in.
        <span class="newline"><b>Production</b> - the website that all members see</span>
        <span class="newline"><b>Sandbox</b> - where you can try things out to see how they work without having an impact on what members see. It is easier to correct errors in this environment than in Production.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The Sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. (E.g. our sandbox environment is dev.raleighhog.com)
        <span class="newline mini-paragraph">Login credentials are the same for both environments</span>
      </p>
      <p>You can see that the Sandbox is a mirror of Production but also note that changes made to the Production environment may take a few days, or more, to show in the Sandbox. They are not synced daily. (Syncing is done from Production to Sandbox. Not vice versa.)
        <span class="newline">If you make an error in the Sandbox that you cannot correct, contact the Administrator (Russ) to get it back in sync with Production if you cannot wait a few days until they sync up again.</span>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Directories</h2>
      <p>Use the read/write access to directories to your advantage. Do not just dump files or images into a directory. Rather, create subdirectories as needed.
        <span class="newline">For example, in the <code>activities</code> directory you can create one subdirectory to place images for destination rides and another subdirectory for images for dealer events. It's clear to you, and to others, what the different directories are for.</span>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the aforementioned directories, each assignable role also has read/write permission to a <code>users</code> directory. This directory is unique to each person, even those that share the same role cannot see another's user directory.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Team member - Primary Officer versus Chapter Officer versus Road Captain</h2>
      <p>There are three different pages that show the Primary Officers, Chapter Officers and Road Captains. The four Primary Officers display on the Home page. Chapter Officers and Road Captains each have pages in the About Us menu.
        <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
          A member may have a dual role. That is, in addition to being a Primary Officer or a Chapter Officer they may be a Primary Officer AND a Road Captain or a Chapter Officer AND a Road Captain. When you 'Create Team Member' for someone that has dual roles be sure and keep the roles separate. That means you will add that team member twice. Once where you'll check the box if they are a Primary Officer or Chapter Officer and the second time where you check the box for the Road Captain role.</span>
        <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
          This will help when ordering the Chapter Officers and Road Captains pages. For instance, when viewing the Chapter Officers I assign a weight to each of the officers to order how each one is displayed.
        </span>
        <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
          In a similar way on the Road Captains page, I want the Safety Officer and Head Road Captain to display first so they are assigned higher weights. I then assign a weight to each of the remaining Road Captains so they are listed alphabetically.
        </span>
      </p>

      <h2>Creating a Basic Page</h2>
      <p>Know that when creating a basic page, by default, non-authenticated users can view the page</p>
      <p>If the page you are creating should only been seen by authenticated users, a best-practice is to give the page a Title, provide a menu link and then Save the page. You can then go to the page and click the 'Access control' tab to configure the access control settings for the page. Submit the settings to save them prior to editing the page and filling in the content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Event Calendar</h2>
      <p>While we want as many people as possible to attend and enjoy our rides/events there is a difference between an "open" event and a "closed" event. Be sure you understand the difference and mark events appropriately.</p>
      <p>Full information can be found in the HOG Chapter Handbook. You can also check with your HOG Regional Manager for clarification.</p>
      <p>The big difference between the two is liability. For your HOG Chapter the majority of rides/events are "closed". This means that 51% of the participants need to be local chapter members. If this is not true, the ride/event can still take place but it is no longer considered a chapter event.</p>
      <p>In order for a ride/event to be considered an "open" event (e.g. Open Chapter Ride/Open Event) additional insurance is needed. The chapter needs to apply for this weeks in advance of the ride/event and it needs to be approved.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Galleries</h2>
      <p>By default, the Galleries display in reverse chronological order. This means the newest galleries added are displayed first. If you give dates to your galleries you may potentially have galleries that do not display in the correct timeline if they are not loaded in order. For instance, if you add a gallery called <i>April 2022</i> and then add a gallery called <i>Dec 2021</i> this older gallery will display first
        <span class="newline mini-paragraph">
          You can manually order galleries by setting the 'Authored on' date in the 'Authoring information' section to the date the pictures were taken. (When editing, the field has a sample of the format to use.)
        </span>
        <span class="newline">
          Note: Only the Webmaster role can see/edit this field.
