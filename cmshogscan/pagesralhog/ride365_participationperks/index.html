    <h2>New Perks for Ride 365 Participants</h2>

    <p>The Harley Owners Group is turning 40 in 2023 and in recognition of that milestone, we’re adding some new perks for members who participate in Ride 365 challenges and other H.O.G. programs. Based on member feedback, we’ve also enhanced some existing programs to increase the incentive to participate or make it easier for members to earn rewards and recognition for the miles they ride and experiences they achieve. Here are a few highlights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Dealership Check-In Challenge</i> participants will now be rewarded for more achievement levels along their journey, with awards received for 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 or more check-ins. Here are the new reward levels:
        <ul>
          <li>10-24 points: Ride 365 Dealership Check-In Challenge pin and patch</li>

          <li>50-74 points: $50 Norscot gift certificate for exclusive H.O.G. merchandise and H.O.G. Eagle wall medallion</li>
          <li>75-99 points: $75 Norscot gift certificate</li>
          <li>100 points or more: $100 Norscot gift certificate</li>

          <li>For each prize level range, participants receive all prizes listed for that level in addition to all prizes for previous levels achieved</li>
