    <h1>Help for your New Role</h1>
    <p>Congratulations on your new role in the Raleigh NC Chapter. Your role gives you the permissions to make changes on the Chapter website. Depending on your role, one of the following pages will help guide you with step by step instructions to successfully make updates.</p>
    <p>There are two environments in which to work.
      <span class="newline">The first, the <i>Sandbox</i> environment, is where you should try things out to get comfortable with your new role. Here you can make changes, or try things out, without affecting what members see. Remember, it's best if you first start out by making changes in the sandbox environment until you are comfortable making changes. It is much easier to correct any mistakes in this environment. Also, do not hesitate to contact your webmaster for help.</span>
      <span class="newline">The second, the <i>Production</i> environment, is the website that all chapter members see. This environment is where you make the updates/changes that everyone sees.</span>
    </p>
    <p>The following guides were written for the Raleigh NC Chapter website. Although certain steps may be specific to the Raleigh NC Chapter website the overall steps should be generic enough that other chapters using HOG[SCAN] should be able to follow along with slight modifications.</p>

    <p>Use the following guides to help you;
    <ul>
      <li><a href="procedures/EventCalUpdate.html" target="_blank">update/add events to the Event Calendar</a></li>
