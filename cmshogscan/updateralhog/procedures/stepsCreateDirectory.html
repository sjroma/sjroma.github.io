  <h1>Subdirectory Creation</h1>

  <article class="notes">
    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please use caution when in the directories. You have the ability to delete files, and directories. This should <b>never</b> be done.</li>
      <li>Not all roles see every directory. You can <a href="https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/cmswebsite/#assign" target="_blank">check the Assignable Roles section in the <i>HogScan Setup Notes</i> document</a> to see which roles can see which directories.</li>
      <li>This tutorial shows how to create a subdirectory under one of the five (5) predefined directories; <code class="code-font">shared</code>, <code class="code-font">primary_officers</code>, <code class="code-font">activities</code>, <code class="code-font">road_captains</code> or <code class="code-font">membership</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>Note: The <code class="code-font">users</code> directory is unique to each individual. Any subdirectories created, or files added, cannot be seen/shared with other users.</li>
          <li>Note: The standard for directory/subdirectory names says;
            <ul>
              <li>names must begin with a letter and may not end with an underscore</li>
              <li>only use letters, numbers and underscores in names</li>
              <li>avoid the use of multiple consecutive underscores; these can be hard to read</li>
              <li>use underscores where you would naturally include a space in the name (e.g. first name becomes first_name).</li>
              <li>keep the length to a maximum of 30 characters</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This tutorial covers creating a subdirectory and deleting a subdirectory that was inadvertently created. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section.

    <h2>Create a New Subdirectory</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user" target="_blank">Login to your account on raleighhog.com</a></li>
      <li>Click the <b>My account</b> link in the navbar. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1a.jpg" alt="screenshot showing my account link"></li>
      <li>On your account page, click the <b>File browser</b> tab. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1b.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of file browser tab"></li>
      <li>The ensuing page shows all the directories. Depending on your role, you may only see a subset of them.
        <span class="newline">Note: when first viewing the directories the <code class="code-font">users</code> directory is expanded by default. As noted above, this directory is unique to each individual and will not be covered here. see image below</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1c.jpg" alt="screenshot of directories page">
      </li>
      <li>To create a subdirectory you must first select the directory for which the subdirectory will be a child. For this tutorial, we will create a subdirectory under the <i>activities</i> directory.
        <ol>
          <li>Click the <i>activities</i> subdirectory to highlight it. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1d.jpg" alt=" "></li>
          <li>Click <b>Directory</b> in the toolbar and the pop-up appears. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1e.jpg" alt=" "></li>
          <li>Enter the name of the subdirectory (following the naming convention above) in the <b>Subdirectory name</b> field.
            <span class="newline">Click the <b>Add</b> button.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1f.jpg" alt=" ">
          </li>
          <li>A success message briefly pops up confirming the subdirectory creation and you will see the newly created subdirectory. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1g.jpg" alt=" "></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>You can create a subdirectory within a subdirectory. The following steps will create subdirectories under the <i>calendar_images</i> subdirectory we just created. Recall that we need to select the directory where we want the child.
        <ol>
          <li>First, click the <i>calendar_images</i> subdirectory name then click <b>Directory</b> from the toolbar to get the pop-up. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1h.jpg" alt=" "></li>
          <li>In the <b>Subdirectory name</b> field enter the new subdirectory name, then click the <b>Add</b> button. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1i.jpg" alt=" "></li>
          <li>A success message briefly pops up and the newly created subdirectory can be seen. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1j.jpg" alt=" "></li>
          <li>Repeating steps <b class="number-reuse">6.1</b> through <b class="number-reuse">6.3</b> I created two additional subdirectories (<i>dealer_events</i> and <i>loh_events</i>) for <i>calendar_images</i>.</li>
          <li>The following image shows the three subdirectories for the <i>calendar_images</i> subdirectory. These additional subdirectories will hopefully make it easier to organize, and find, images for different events being added to the event calendar. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories1k.jpg" alt=" "></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Following the steps starting from step <b class="number-reuse">5</b>, you can create subdirectories as needed.</li>
    </ol>

  <article id="del-subdir" class="create">
    <h2>Delete a Subdirectory</h2>
    <h3>Only follow these steps if you inadvertently created a subdirectory</h3>
    <p>Only delete a subdirectory if you created it and know it is not needed. Extra caution should be taken before deleting any subdirectory that contains pdf's, images, etc as deleting them may break existing links on your website.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In this example, a subdirectory named <i>destination_rides</i> was inadvertently created in the <i>road_captains</i> directory and we want to delete it. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories2a.jpg" alt=" "></li>
      <li>Ensure that we are in the correct directory for the subdirectory we want to delete
        <ol>
          <li>Click on the <i>road_captains</i> directory to highlight it.
            <span class="newline">Then click <b>Directory</b> in the tool bar. The pop-up appears.</span>
            <span class="newline">Enter the name of the subdirectory to be deleted in the <b>Subdirectory name</b> box, then click the <b>Remove button</b></span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories2b.jpg" alt=" ">
          </li>
          <li>You will get a confirmation pop-up asking if you're sure you want to delete the subdirectory. Click the <b>OK</b> button to comfirm.
            <span class="newline">Note: You will always get a pop-up when trying to delete a subdirectory (or any files within a directory/subdirectory) so that you do not inadvertently delete something. see image below</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories2c.jpg" alt=" ">
          <li>There will be a brief confirmation pop-up saying the subdirectory was deleted and, as shown in the following screenshot, the subdirectory has been deleted from the <i>road_captains</i> directory. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/directories2d.jpg" alt=" "></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>That's it! You have successfully deleted an inadvertently created subdirectory.</li>
    </ol>
