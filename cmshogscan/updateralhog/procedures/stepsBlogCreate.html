    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will also help with any questions you may have</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Last names, phone numbers and/or member personal email addresses are not to be displayed in any forward facing document so they are not put in any Blog entry. The Blog is forward facing.
        <ul>
          <li>'Forward facing' means any page that a non-authenticated user has access to. A non-authenticated user is one that has not successfully logged in.</li>
          <li>The policy of maintaining privacy by not exposing last names, phone numbers, personal email addresses, personal motorcycle information, etc is from HOG national.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "Harley-Davidson discourages H.O.G.<sup>&reg;</sup> chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian". We will adhere to this policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Create the Entry</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user" target="_blank">Login to your account</a> and you will see a smaller Navigational Bar (navbar) on top of the Chapter navbar. See image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/blogEntry1.jpg" alt="screenshot of navbar"></li>
      <li>Click <b>Add content</b> to go to the following screen... See image below
        <ol>
          <li><b>Article</b> - creates a Blog entry, this is the purpose of this document</li>
          <li><i>Event</i> - creates an event on the calendar, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><i>Event checkin</i> - the check-in process uses the HOG[SCAN] app, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Forum topic</i> - forum has been turned off for the website, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Gallery</i> - allows adding to the Gallery, not used here and a different document</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="screenshot" src="../images/blogEntry2.jpg" alt="screenshot showing selecting event">
      </li>
      <li>Click <b>Article</b> and the <b>Create Article</b> page opens... see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/blogEntry3.jpg" alt="screenshot of create article screen">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Title</b> is a required field. Give a title that is informative and makes a member want to read the entry.</li>
          <li><b>Media</b> - attach one image here. As with the title, it should be something that is eye-catching and will make members want to read the blog entry.</li>
          <li><b>Blog Categories</b> - choose a fitting category or leave it blank</li>
          <li><b>Body</b> (Edit summary) - will contain the text and any pics for the blog entry. Hover over an icon to see a tooltip pop-up of the function of that icon. The icons highlighted in red are ones that are of use. The rest can be ignored as there is no need to use HTML/CSS to style the copy.
            <ol>
              <li><code class="code-font">Link</code> icon - e.g. used to provide a link if needed</li>
              <li><code class="code-font">Image</code> icon - e.g. used to include any additional images you may want to include in the body of the blog</li>
              <li><code class="code-font">Size</code> dropdown - e.g. the font size defaults to 14px. It reads easier if you choose 16 from the dropdown</li>
              <li><code class="code-font">Bold</code> icon - e.g. used to make text stand out</li>
              <li><code class="code-font">Italic</code> icon - e.g. usually a title is shown in italics</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page to complete. see image below<img class="screenshot" src="../images/blogEntry4.jpg" alt="screenshot of bottom of create article screen">
        <ol>
          <li>While optional, it's always good to leave a brief sentence regarding what you did. For instance, "initial blog create" or if editing, a brief note on what you changed or added. It helps the next person understand what was done.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button</li>
      <li>The Blog entry is now viewable on the website</li>
