    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This environment is different than the website. There is only one, shared, account that is used for logging in. Do NOT change the Email or the Password.</li>
      <li>There are only two sections in which you will work. They will show as separate sections within this document. The two sections are;
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#template">Update a Template</a></li>
          <li><a href="#campaign">Send a Campaign</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For the purposes of this document, a campaign is what was previously called an 'email blast'.</li>
      <li>In this document the Navagational Bar is referred to as the navbar.
        <ul>
          <li>Every website has a navbar. It normally appears at the top of the page or on the left side of the page. As a user clicks links in the navbar to go to different pages within the website, the navbar retains its position making it easy for the user to navigate to other pages within the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <i>Monthly Chapter Meeting</i> template contains sensitive information, the link to join the Zoom meeting as well as the Meeting ID and Passcode
      <ul>
        <li>This information should never be posted in the Event Calendar where it can be accessed by anyone in the world. It is only shared with current chapter members through the campaign.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

      <li>After a successful login you will see a navbar list on the left listing all that can be done with the HOG[SCAN] Mailer. This document is only concerned with <b>Campaigns</b> and <b>Templates</b>. Everything else is out of scope for this document.
        <span class="newline">Click <b>Campaigns</b> in the navbar to expand the dropdown to choose either <b>All Campaigns</b> or <b>Email Templates</b>.</span>
        <span class="newline">As shown in the screenshot, you can also click the quick link for either <b>Create template</b> or <b>Send campaign</b>.</span>
        See image below<img class="screenshot" src="../images/HOGScanMailer2.jpg" alt="screenshot of the hogscan mailer landing page">
      </li>
      <li>Prior to sending a campaign it is necessary to prepare the template we want to send.<span class="newline">Click <b>Campaigns</b> from the navbar to expand the dropdown, then click <b>Email Templates</b>.</span><span class="newline"> The following screen appears. Note on the page that the '<b>My templates</b>' tab is selected as shown by it being underlined.

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Note, the templates may not display in the same order as shown in the previous image.
        <span class="newline">We mainly use only four (4) of the templates. The ones used most are;</span>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Upcoming Chapter Events</b> - Sent out once a week, on Wednesday's, to inform members of upcoming rides for the weekend.</li>
          <li><b>Monthly Newsletter</b> - Sent once a month to inform members that the monthly newsletter has been posted to the website.</li>
          <li><b>Monthly Chapter Meeting</b> - Sent once a month, on Monday's, to remind/inform members of the upcoming monthly chapter meeting.</li>
          <li><b>Upcoming LoH Events</b> - Sent once a month, on Wednesday's, to remind/inform LoH members of their monthly meeting.
            <ol>
              <li>This same template is used for any special meetings or parties that are unique to, and for, LoH.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The other templates were have, in no particular order, are;
            <ol>
              <li><b>Monthly Newsletter &amp; Chapter Mtg</b> - Occasionally the Newsletter announcement coincides with the reminder for the upcoming monthly meeting. This lets us send one campaign instead of two.</li>
              <li><b>Upcoming Road Capt'n Events</b> - Has not been used yet. Road Captain meetings are few and the ones we've had are open to members that want to be RC's.</li>
              <li><b>Christmas Party</b> - This was recently created to remind members that there was a cut-off date for RSVPing to the Annual Christmas party. Can be used for the Valentine's party if the need arises.</li>
              <li><b>Dealership News</b> - Recently created to as a favor to the dealership to let members know there were openings for Riding Academy coaches.</li>
              <li><b>Raleigh HOG Board Mtg</b> - Was never used. It was an exercise in creating a template when we first started with the mailer.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Do NOT change the template names. The names are used in the campaigns and we have a precedent/standard that has been in place for over a year.</li>
