    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Add a Team Member</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user" target="_blank">Login to your account on raleighhog.com</a> and there will be a smaller Navigation Bar (navbar) on top of the Chapter navbar. See image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNavbar.jpg" alt="editor navbar"></li>
      <li>Hover your mouse over the '<b>Content</b>' link and when the menu expands click the '<b>Add Content</b>' link. The following screen will display. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorTeamMember1.jpg" alt="screenshot of the add content page">
        <ol>
          <li>Note: Ignore 'Ask a question!' Clicking it will send it to an admin where it will not be seen. See your webmaster for any questions.</li>
          <li>If you clicked the '<b>Content</b>' link, you will need to click the '<b>+ Add Content</b>' link on the page that pops-up. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNewsletterContentb.jpg" alt="screenshot of add content link"></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Add Content</b> page has links to the following:
        <ol>
          <li><i>Article</i> - creates a blog entry, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><i>Basic page</i> - creates a page, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><i>Event</i> - this is done by the Activities Officer, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><i>Forum topic</i> - forum has been turned off for the website, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Gallery</i> - this will be done by the Photographer, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><i>Newsletter</i> - this will be done by the newsletter editor, not used here and a different document</li>
          <li><b>Team Member</b> - create a team member. The purpose of this document</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Click the '<b>Team Member</b>' link and the following page opens. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorTeamMember2.jpg" alt="screenshot of create team member page">
        <ol>
          <li><b>First Name &amp; Last Initial</b> - Fill in the Team Member's name this field is required</li>
          <li><b>Member Type</b> - Choose only one Member type
            <ul>
              <li><i>Primary Officer</i> will display on the Home page - the four Primary Officers are Director, Assistant Director, Secretary and Treasurer</li>
              <li><i>Chapter Officer</i> will appear on the Chapter Officers page found in the 'About Us' menu</li>
              <li><i>Road Captain</i> will appear on the Road Captains page found in the 'About Us' menu</li>
              <li>Note: if the member has a dual role (Primary Officer &amp; Road Captain or Chapter Officer &amp; Road Captain) you will create that member twice selecting the appropriate role each time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Image</b> - add the members picture by clicking the '<b>Choose File</b>' button, selecting the image from your local computer and then clicking the '<b>Upload</b>' button. A thumbnail image will display after a successful upload</li>
          <li><b>Email Address</b> - add the member's email address. Since this is a forward facing page I only add the local email addresses of the Primary and Chapter Officers. E.g. <i>director@localchapter.com</i> Road Captains do not need to have personal email addresses displayed</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When all fields are filled in scroll to the bottom of the page. see image below <img src="../images/editorTeamMember3.jpg" alt="screenshot of bottom of create team member page">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Weight</b> - optionally add a number to organize how Chapter Officers and Road Captains display on the respective pages. The higher numbers display first. For example, on the Road Captains page I want the Safety Officer and Head Road Captain to display first and then show the remaining RC's alphabetically.</li>
          <li>Optionally add a <b>Revision log message</b>. Something as simple as 'initial team member create' lets the next person editing know what was done previously</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button to complete</li>
      <li>Repeat steps <b style="color: #f77;">2</b> through <b style="color: #f77;">6</b> to add additional Team Members</li>
    </ol>
  </article>

  <article class="no-role">
    <p>You may have a chapter member that leads destination rides but is neither a Chapter Officer or a Road Captain and you want their picture to show as the Event Coordinator when the event is displayed on the Calendar.</p>
    <p>Create the Team Member by only filling in the required <i>First Name &amp; Last Initial</i> field and the optional <i>Image</i> field. Save it.</p>
    <p>The Activities Officer will be able to select this member as the Event Coordinator and the member will not appear on either of the pages for Chapter Officers or Road Captains.</p>
