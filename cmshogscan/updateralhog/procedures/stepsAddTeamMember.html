    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For this tutorial, Primary Officer, Discretionary Officer and Road Captain are as described in the <i>H.O.G. Chapter Charter</i>. Ride Leader is a member that occasionally leads a ride but does not have a role that is defined in the <i>Chapter Charter</i>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This tutorial covers adding a team member, adding a ride leader and updating/editing a ride leader. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section;

    <h2>Add a Team Member</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user/login/" target="_blank">Login to your account on raleighhog.com</a> and there will be a smaller Navigation Bar (navbar) on top of the Chapter navbar. See image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNavbar.jpg" alt="editor navbar"></li>

        <ol>
          <li>If you clicked the '<b>Content</b>' link, you will need to click the '<b>+ Add Content</b>' link on the page that pops-up. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNewsletterContentb.jpg" alt="screenshot of add content link"></li>
          <li>The <b>Add Content</b> page has links to the following:
            <ol>

              <li><i>Basic page</i> - creates a page, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
              <li><i>Event</i> - this is done by the Activities Officer, not used here and a different tutorial</li>

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Note: Ignore 'Ask a question!' Clicking it will send it to an admin where it will not be seen. See your webmaster for any questions.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Click the '<b>Team Member</b>' link and the following page opens. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorTeamMember2.jpg" alt="screenshot of create team member page">
        <ol>
          <li><b>First Name &amp; Last Initial</b> - Fill in the Team Member's name. This field is required.</li>
          <li><b>Member Type</b> - Choose only one Member type
            <ul>
              <li><i>Primary Officer</i> will display on the Home page - the four Primary Officers are Director, Assistant Director, Secretary and Treasurer</li>
              <li><i>Chapter Officer</i> will appear on the Chapter Officers page found in the 'About Us' menu</li>
              <li><i>Road Captain</i> will appear on the Road Captains page found in the 'About Us' menu</li>
              <li>Note: if the member has a dual role (Primary Officer &amp; Road Captain or Chapter Officer &amp; Road Captain) you will create that member twice selecting the appropriate role each time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Image</b> - add the members picture by clicking the '<b>Choose File</b>' button, selecting the image from your local computer and then clicking the '<b>Upload</b>' button. A thumbnail image will display after a successful upload</li>
          <li><b>Email Address</b> - add the member's email address. Since this is a forward facing page I only add the local email addresses of the Primary and Chapter Officers. E.g. <i>director@localchapter.com</i> Road Captains do not need to have personal email addresses displayed</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When all fields are filled in scroll to the bottom of the page. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorTeamMember3.jpg" alt="screenshot of bottom of create team member page">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Weight</b> - optionally add a number to organize how Chapter Officers and Road Captains display on the respective pages. The higher numbers display first. For example, on the Road Captains page I want the Safety Officer and Head Road Captain to display first and then show the remaining RC's alphabetically.</li>
          <li>Optionally add a <b>Revision log message</b>. Something as simple as 'initial team member create' lets the next person editing know what was done previously</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button to complete</li>
      <li>Repeat steps <b class="number-reuse">2</b> through <b class="number-reuse">6</b> to add additional Team Members</li>
    </ol>
