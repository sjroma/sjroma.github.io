    <h2>Managing Your Chapter Membership</h2>
    <p>Using the <i>Manage My Chapter</i> feature in <i>Chapter Officer Resources</i> is an easy way to maintain an accurate count of your active chapter members. Use this function to review your member list and add or delete members from your active roster to ensure you have an accurate list of your membership. Updating your membership roll is also a good opportunity to reach out to your members to confirm their contact information is up to date and that they have active profiles in the system.</p>
