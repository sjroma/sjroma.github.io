  <h1>Manage Chapter Membership</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <p>As time goes on there will be new members joining your chapter and, unfortunately, there will also be some members that leave.</p>

    <p>National only knows about active HOG members. They do not know if these members have joined a local chapter. Using the <i>Manage My Chapter</i> feature in <i>Chapter Officer Resources</i> is an easy way to maintain an accurate count of your active chapter members. You can use this function to review your member list and add, or delete, members from your active roster to ensure you have an accurate list of your membership. Updating your membership roll is also a good opportunity to reach out to your members to confirm their contact information is up to date and that they have active profiles in the system.</p>

    <p>Please note, access to the FIND/ADD MEMBERS button and the REMOVE SELECTED MEMBERS button within Manage My Chapter on National's website is granted to the four Primary Officers and the Membership Officer. This is set up by your local HOG Manager. Ensure it is current when new officers take their roles.
      <span>Within HOGScan, only the Primary Officer and Membership Officer roles have access to member information.</span>
    </p>

    <p>This tutorial will have one section showing how to add and/or delete members in National and another section showing how to Import/Update your roster in HOGScan.
