    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will also help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>National discourages HOG chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian. We will adhere to this policy.</li>
    </ul>

            <ol>
              <li>MMM YYYY [ eventName1 + eventName2 + etc ] where MMM is the three letter abbreviation for the month and YYYY is the year. (For consistancy, in the Galleries if there are images for the chapter meeting the event name is <i>Monthly mtg)</i></li>

        <ol>
          <li>I've only used the 'UPLOAD' method. Instructions following are based on that</li>
          <li>Note 'Drag files here'. This is where the you will drop the images to be uploaded

          <li>Note: There is an 'Ask a question' button that has been removed from the next few images. Do not use this button as questions go to an Admin and will not be seen. Contact your webmaster if you have any questions or issues.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>After dragging and dropping images click 'Start upload'. see image below<img class="screenshot" src="../images/photogGalleryUpload1.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of start upload"></li>
      <li>Depending on the number of images and size of each image being uploaded it will take a few minutes for all to upload. Wait until all images have uploaded.
