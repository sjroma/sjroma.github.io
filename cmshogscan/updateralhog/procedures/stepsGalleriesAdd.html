    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Rather than having many small galleries, events for each month are placed in one gallery with the title <code>MMM YYYY [ eventName1 + eventName2 + etc ]</code> where <code>MMM</code> is the first three letters of the month, <code>YYYY</code> is the year and the event names are in square brackets.</li>
      <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "Harley-Davidson discourages H.O.G.<sup>&reg;</sup> chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian". We will adhere to this policy.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>The Create Gallery page opens. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/photog3CreateGallery.jpg" alt="screenshot of create gallery page">
        <ol>
          <li>Give an appropriate <b>Title</b>. We use the following naming convention;
            <ol>
              <li><b>MMM YYYY [ eventName1 + eventName2 + etc ]</b> where MMM is the three letter abbreviation for the month and YYYY is the year. (For consistancy throughout our website, if the Gallery will contain images for the chapter meeting the event name is <i>Monthly mtg)</i></li>

          </li>
          <li>Click the <b>Browse</b> button</li>

        <ol>
          <li>I've only used the 'UPLOAD' method. The instructions that follow are based on that</li>
          <li>Note 'Drag files here'. This is where the you will drop the images to be uploaded
            <ul>

            <ol>
              <li>Note: There is an 'Ask a question' button that has been removed from the next few images. Do not use this button as questions go to an Admin and will not be seen. Contact your webmaster if you have any questions or issues.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>After dragging and dropping images click <b>Start upload</b>. see image below<img class="screenshot" src="../images/photogGalleryUpload1.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of start upload"></li>
      <li>Depending on the number of images and size of each image being uploaded it will take a few minutes for all to upload. Wait until all images have uploaded.
