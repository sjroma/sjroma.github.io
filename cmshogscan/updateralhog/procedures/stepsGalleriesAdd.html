    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Rather than having many small galleries, events for each month are placed in one gallery with the title
        <span class="newline"><code class="code-font">MMM YYYY [ eventName1 + eventName2 + etc ]</code></span> where <code class="code-font">MMM</code> is the first three letters of the month, <code class="code-font">YYYY</code> is the year and the event names are in square brackets.
      </li>
      <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "<i>Harley-Davidson discourages H.O.G.<sup>&reg;</sup> chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian</i>". We adhere to this policy.</li>
      <li>Note, images to upload must be one of the following file types; <code class="code-font">png, gif, jpg</code> or <code class="code-font">jpeg</code></li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
