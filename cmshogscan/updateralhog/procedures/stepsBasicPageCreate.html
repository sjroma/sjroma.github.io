    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Last names, phone numbers and/or member personal email addresses are not to be displayed in any forward facing document.
        <ul>
          <li>'Forward facing' means any page that a non-authenticated user has access to. A non-authenticated user is one that has not successfully logged in.</li>
          <li>The policy of maintaining privacy by not exposing last names, phone numbers, personal email addresses, personal motorcycle information, etc is from HOG national.</li>
          <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "Any content you list on your site shall not reveal private information about the members of your chapter, including names. If you need to use a name, use a nickname, mfirst name and last initial or just a first name."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "Harley-Davidson discourages H.O.G.<sup>&reg;</sup> chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian". We will adhere to this policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Create a Basic Page</h2>
    <p>When creating a basic page, by default, non-authenticated users can view the page.</p>
    <p>If the page you are creating should only been seen by authenticated users, a best-practice is to give the page a <code class="code-font">Title</code>, provide a <code class="code-font">Menu link title</code>, <code class="code-font">Description</code> and <code class="code-font">Parent item</code> then <code class="code-font">Save</code> the page. Open the page from the navbar, click the 'Access control' tab and configure the access control settings for the page. Submit the settings to save them prior to editing the page and filling in the content.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user" target="_blank">Login to your account on raleighhog.com</a> and there will be a smaller Navigation Bar (navbar) on top of the Chapter navbar.</li>
      <li>Hover your mouse over the '<b>Content</b>' link and when the menu expands click the '<b>Add Content</b>' link. The following screen will display. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNavbar.jpg" alt="screenshot of the add content page">
        <ol>
          <li>If you clicked the '<b>Content</b>' link, you will need to click the '<b>+ Add Content</b>' link on the page that pops-up. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/editorNewsletterContentb.jpg" alt="screenshot of add content link"></li>
          <li>Note: Ignore 'Ask a question!' Clicking it will send it to an admin where it will not be seen. See your webmaster for any questions.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Add Content</b> page displays showing links to the following; see image below
        <ol>
          <li><i>Article</i> - creates a blog entry, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
          <li><b>Basic page</b> - creates a basic page. The purpose of this tutorial</li>
          <li><i>Event</i> - creates a calendar event, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
          <li><i>Forum topic</i> - forum has been turned off for our website, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Gallery</i> - adds images to the galleries, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
          <li><i>Newsletter</i> - this will be done by the newsletter editor, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
          <li><i>Team Member</i> - creates a team member, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage1.jpg" alt="screenshot of add content page showing Basic page location">
      </li>
      <li>Click <b>Basic Page</b>. The following screen will display.
        <span class="newline">Fill in the required <b>Title</b> field. For example, <code class="code-font">Frequently Asked Questions</code></span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2.jpg" alt="screenshot of Create Basic Page">
        <ol>
          <li><b>Body</b> is where you put the information you want to appear on your page. The icons outlined in the ribbon are the ones you will use the most. Hover your mouse over them to see a brief description of what they are for.
            <span class="newline">Quick note regarding the <b>Size</b> button. I always choose 16 because, by default, all web pages are presented with a font size of 16 pixels. It makes for easier reading. By default, <i>HOGScan</i> presents pages at 14 pixels and it can be a little hard to read.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2a.jpg" alt="screenshot showing top half of create basic page">
          </li>
          <li>Click the <b>Provide a menu link</b> box. You will want people visiting your site a way to see your page. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2b.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of provide a menu link in bottom half of creat basic page"></li>
          <li>After clicking the <b>Provide a menu link</b> box you are presented with the following;
            <span class="newline"><b>Menu link title</b> - by default this will be the same as the Title from step <b class="number-reuse">4</b>. In our example we used 'Frequently Asked Questions'. That title is long in the navbar and wraps so I choose to change it here to FAQ.</span>
            <span class="newline"><b>Description</b> - Since I shortened the menu link title, I will fill in the full name here, 'Frequently Asked Questions'.</span>
            <span class="newline"><b>Parent item</b> - This is where you want your page to appear in the navbar. The following step (<b class="number-reuse">4.4</b> explains how to select where you want your new page to appear.</span>
            <span class="newline"><b>Weight</b> - All created pages default to a weight of zero. They will stack on top of each other as they are created. Give your page a weight so it displays in the proper order in your navbar.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2c.jpg" alt="screenshot showing expanded options after clicking provide menu link checkbox">
          </li>
          <li>Click the down carat in the <b>Parent item</b> box to expand the dropdown and select where you want the new page to appear in the navbar.
            <span class="newline">The new page can be under one of the main navbar links or under a sublink.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2d.jpg" alt="screenshot showing options after parent item dropdown is expanded">
          </li>
          <li>Click the <b>Revision information link</b>. Although optional, a best practice is to fill in the <b>Revision log message</b> field with a brief explanation of what was done.
            <span class="newline">Click the <b>Save</b> button to finish.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPage2e.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of revision message field and save button">
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>This step is required if you want the page to be seen only by <b>Authenticated user's</b>.
        <span class="newline">Open your saved page and click the <b>ACCESS CONTROL</b> tab.</span>
        <span class="newline">If your page should only be seen by an authenticated user, that is only seen by a member that is logged in, uncheck the two boxes for <b>anonymous user</b> as shown in the screenshot below.</span>
        <span class="newline">Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the <b>Submit</b> button to save your changes.</span>
        <span class="newline">
          <h5>NOTE: There is a defect where the Editor role cannot see the ACCESS CONTROL tab. Currently only the Webmaster or Primary Officer roles can make this change. The defect has been reported.</h5>
        </span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPageAccess1a.jpg" alt="screenshot showing anonymous user box unchecked">
        <ol>
          <li>The image below shows the location of the <b>Submit</b> button. You must click the <b>Submit</b> button to save your changes. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPageAccess1b.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of submit button"></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If needed, you can grant update access to one, or more, people by adding their username in the <b>Add user</b> field. Click <b>GRANT UPDATE ACCESS</b> to expand the dropdown and see the field.
        <span class="newline">For instance, our recording secretary has update access to the Meeting Minutes page so the monthly meeting minutes can be updated. They do not need to be given the Editor role as the meeting minutes page is the only page they need to update.</span>
        <span class="newline">Note; This field has to be populated with their username. If the member has not updated their username field with a name, you will have to use the default which is their HOG ID number. (Hint, have them edit their profile and update the username field. It's much easier to read a name rather than cross referencing a HOG ID number.)</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/basicPageAccess1c.jpg" alt="screenshot showing grant update access expanded">
      </li>
      <li>Success! You've created a new page for your website.</li>
