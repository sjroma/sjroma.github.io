  <h1>Member's Participation Report</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <h2>General notes</h2>
    <p>HogScan offers a <i>Points by Date Range</i> report that shows the total points each member has accumulated within the range.
      <span class="newline">By default, every event a chapter has is assigned the same number of points regardless of whether the event is a ride, meeting, or some other activity.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Assigning different point values to the different events may or may not help to identify participation in different event types because points accumulate over time.</p>
    <p>Some chapters use a members ride participation to give awards at the end of the calendar year. This tutorial will show how to view a members activity report to break out their participation in various events...meetings, rides, etc.</p>
