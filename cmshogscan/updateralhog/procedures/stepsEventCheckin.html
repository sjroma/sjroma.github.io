  <h1>Website Event Checkin</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <p>Checking members into an event is typically done using the HogScan smartphone application. It is possible to check in members to events using the website but the process is time consuming. The reason being because you check them in using their Username. If the member has not edited their profile, the default Username is their HOG ID. It takes time to look it up.</p>
    
    <p>The Primary Officer, Membership Officer and Activities Officer roles can do an event checkin on the website but, the Activities Officer role does not have access to member information. That role will not be able to look up the member if the member has not edited their profile and put in a Username. Also, if two (or more) members each named Mike have set their Username to "Mike", the Activities Officer role has no way of distinguishing who is who.</p>
    
    <p>As long as the event shows in the HogScan smartphone application, use it to check in the member.</p>
