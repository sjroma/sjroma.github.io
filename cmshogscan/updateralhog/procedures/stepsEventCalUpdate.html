  <h1>Update the Event Calendar</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can (and should) <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test/practice in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>There are two Event Calendars
        <ul>
          <li>Chapter Event Calender - the main calendar, anyone on our website can see all events</li>
          <li>Road Captain Event Calendar - viewable only by Raleigh NC Chapter Road Captains after successful login to their account</li>
          <li>Note: The calendar in the smartphone application (HogScan) is synced with the website Event calendar. Populating the website calendar populates the application's calendar.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>'Event' is a ride, meeting or activity that is posted on the Raleigh NC Chapter Event Calendar. Throughout this tutorial they will all be referred to as event.</li>
      <li>Most of our events are 'closed', meaning members may invite a guest but the event can only take place if there is greater than 51% current Raleigh NC Chapter members. This is a HOG national policy and is due to insurance concerns.
        <ul>
          <li>LoH 'open to all' events are closed events. The 'open to all' statement means the event is not just for LoH members but is open to all Raleigh NC Chapter members, National HOG members and other guests as desired.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A best practice is to not delete an event
        <ul>
          <li>If an event is cancelled or postponed due to inclimate weather, or some other reason, put **CANCELLED** or **POSTPONED** in front of the title and add a short message in the body of the event to keep members informed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Consistancy is key. Do not use different terminology for the same event. For example, throughout the website and in email campaigns our monthly meeting is referred to as "Monthly Chapter Meeting". It should be referred to as such in the Event Calendar so the naming convention is consistant throughout and transparent to end users.
        <ul>
          <li>It also helps when running year end reports. All "Monthly Chapter Meeting" can be grouped. For our Mar - Oct dinner rides a naming convention of "Dinner ride - xxx" (where xxx is the name of the restaurant) makes running year end reports easier.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Last names, phone numbers and/or member personal email addresses are not to be displayed in any forward facing document, so they are not put in any event. The Raleigh NC Chapter Event Calendar is forward facing.
        <ul>
          <li>'Forward facing' means any page that a non-authenticated user has access to. A non-authenticated user is one that has not successfully logged in.</li>
          <li>The policy of maintaining privacy by not exposing last names, phone numbers, personal email addresses, personal motorcycle information, etc is from HOG national.
            <ul>
              <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "<i>Any content you list on your site shall not reveal private information about the members of your chapter, including names. If you need to use a name, use a nickname, first name and last initial or just a first name.</i>"</li>
              <li>From the HOG Chapter Handbook, "<i>Harley-Davidson discourages H.O.G.<sup>&reg;</sup> chapters from publishing any photographs of minor children, even with permission from a parent or guardian</i>". We will adhere to this policy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please use caution when in the directories. You have the ability to delete files. This should <b>never</b> be done.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>This tutorial covers creating an event and adding and image to a directory. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section;

    <h2>Create an Event</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.raleighhog.com/user" target="_blank">Login to your account on raleighhog.com</a> and you will see a smaller Navigational Bar (navbar) on top of the Chapter navbar. See image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityNavBar.jpg" alt="screenshot of navbar"></li>
      <li>Click <b>Add content</b> to go to the following screen... See image below
        <ol>
          <li><i>Article</i> - creates a blog entry, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
          <li><b>Event</b> - this is how Event Calender entries are made and is the purpose of this tutorial</li>
          <li><i>Event checkin</i> - the check-in process uses the HOG[SCAN] app, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Forum topic</i> - forum has been turned off for the website, this is not used</li>
          <li><i>Gallery</i> - you have access to add to the Gallery but this will be done by the Photographer, not used here and a different tutorial</li>
        </ol>
        <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityAddEvent.jpg" alt="screenshot showing selecting event">
      </li>
      <li>Click <b>Event</b> and the <b>Create Event</b> page opens</li>
      <li>There are four required fields. These fields, designated with a red asterisk, must be populated prior to saving the event.
        <ol>
          <li><b>Title</b> - A short, descriptive title</li>
          <li><b>EVENT DATE</b> - Includes Date and Time
            <ol>
              <li><b>Date</b> - Event date formatted as <code class="code-font">mm/dd/yyyy</code></li>
              <li><b>Time</b> - Event time formatted as <code class="code-font">hh:mm</code> followed by <code class="code-font">am</code> or <code class="code-font">pm</code></li>
              <li>Check the <i>Show End Date</i> box when the event is a multi-day event. The second Date / Time fields are populated with the last day of the event.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Event type</b> - our events (rides / meetings) are closed events
            <ol>
              <li><b>Note:</b> If <b>Event type</b> is <i>Road Captain Events</i> or <i>RC pre-rides</i>, the event will only appear on the Road Captain Event Calendar. (The RC Event Calendar can only be viewed by RC's after they've logged in.)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Ride Mileage</b> - this field is not used, it can be left blank. Fill it in if you know it as it may be incorporated in the future.</li>
      <li><b>Points</b> - used only to identify newer members, leave at the default of 10</li>
      <li><b>Event Coordinator</b> - select from the dropdown. If the name isn't in the list leave it blank
        <ol>
          <li>There are members that have dual roles (officer &amp; road captain). I've made it so that road captains have first name, last initial without a period. Select the coordinator from the road captains so if someone with a dual role changes roles, there will not be a change in the calendar.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Image</b> - leave blank. An image, if available, will be included in the Body area. (If populated here it messes with the copy flow and the map.)</li>
      <li><b>Body (Edit summary)</b> - this is where the destination image (if available) and the event details are placed
        <ol>
          <li>The image below shows the <b>Body</b> toolbar <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityBodyToolbar.jpg" alt="screenshot of the body toolbar">
            <ol>
              <li>Hover over an icon to see a tooltip pop-up of the function of that icon. The icons outlined in red are ones that are of use. The rest can be ignored as there is no need to use HTML/CSS to style the copy.
                <ol>
                  <li><code class="code-font">Link</code> icon - e.g. used to provide a link to a hotel to make reservations for overnight trips</li>
                  <li><code class="code-font">Image</code> icon - e.g. used to include an image of the destination in the copy. Images for frequent ride destinations, dealer events and meeting/parties have been preloaded and are currently available.</li>
                  <li><code class="code-font">Size</code> dropdown - e.g. the font size defaults to 14px. It reads easier if you choose 16 from the dropdown.</li>
                  <li><code class="code-font">Bold</code> icon - e.g. used to make text stand out. For instance, <b>Login and click RSVP to repond</b></li>
                  <li><code class="code-font">Italic</code> icon - e.g. the name of the restaurant or destination is usually in italics to make it stand out from the rest of the copy</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Click the <code class="code-font">image</code> icon to add an image to the copy and the following pop-up appears. See image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityAddImage.jpg" alt="screenshot of pop-up to add an image to the event">
            <ol>
              <li>Click the <b>Browse Server</b> button. The following window opens... <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityImageSelect1.jpg" alt="screenshot showing directories"></li>
              <li>Click the <b>activities</b> folder to expand/open it. It expands to show the following... <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityImageSelect2.jpg" alt="screenshot of expanded activities directory"></li>
              <li>Click the <b>calendar_images</b> folder to expand/open it. It expands to show the following... <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityImageSelect3.jpg" alt="screenshot of expanded calendar_images directory"></li>
              <li>Click either <b>dealer_events</b>, <b>destination-rides</b> or <b>meeting_or_party</b> to expand/open to see the available images</li>
              <li>Select the image you wish to use. NOTE: single click the name to see a preview of the image. Double click the name to select it.</li>
              <li>You are brought back to the <b>Image Properties</b> pop-up and you can now see a preview of the image you chose.</li>
              <li><b>Tip:</b> You do not want users to scroll through a large image to see the details of the event. In either the <b>Width</b> or <b>Height</b> boxes change the larger of the two to 400. The image aspect ratio will be maintained and users will appreciate seeing a smaller image.</li>
              <li>Click the <b>OK</b> button</li>
              <li>You can continue editing the <b>Body</b> to add text about the event. <br><b>Tip:</b> hit the spacebar so the text starts on the line below the image.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Editing tip for the <b>Body (Edit summary)</b> section.
            <ol>
              <li>Use the <code class="code-font">Shift+Enter</code> keys to have a break in the line.</li>
              <li>Use the <code class="code-font">Enter</code> key to start a new paragraph.</li>
              <li>Note that in the copy, the times listed match the format of the website timestamp (hh:mm). You want to keep things consistant.</li>
              <li>See image below for demonstraton <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityEditingTip.png" alt="screenshot showing differences between using enter and shift+enter in body copy"></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>EVENT LOCATION</b> section
        <ol>
          <li>Optional, does not have to be filled in</li>
          <li>If known, fill in <b>Street, City</b> &amp; <b>State</b></li>
          <li>Click the "Find Address on Map" button to populate the map <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityAddEvent2.jpg" alt="screenshot showing event location section"></li>

      </li>
      <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page
        <ol>
          <li>Optionally fill in the 'Revision log message' section. Something as simple as "initial event create" is good when first creating the event so others looking can see what was done.
            <span class="newline">If editing, something simple like "update event start time" is good enough. Again, so others looking can see what was done. (Members will not see these notes)</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityAddEvent3.jpg" alt="screenshot showing revision log message and save button">

    <h2>Add an Image to a Directory</h2>
    <p>As time goes by, new ride destinations and events will be added to the calendar that may not have an image. The following steps will help you upload a new image to the appropriate directory.</p>
    <p>This tutorial assumes you have the image you want to upload in a directory on your local machine.</p>

        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>You will see the image filename has been added to the existing images and a preview of the image at the bottom since it is selected.
        <ol>
          <li>If you have another image to add, click the <b>Choose File</b> button and repeat the instructions from step <b class="number-reuse">4</b> above.</li>
          <li>Click the <b>x</b> in the pop-up to close it. see image below <img class="screenshot" src="../images/activityDirUpload6.jpg" alt="screenshot showing successful image upload"></li>
