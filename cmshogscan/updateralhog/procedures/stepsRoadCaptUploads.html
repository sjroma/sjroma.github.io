    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Please use caution when in the directories. You have the ability to delete files. This should <b>never</b> be done.</li>
      <li>Files being uploaded should include a datestamp. This is how we distinguish the latest file to be used.
        <ul>
          <li>For instance, <code class="code-font">titleOfYourFile_YYYYMMDD.pdf</code> where <code class="code-font">YYYY</code> is the four digit year, <code class="code-font">MM</code> is the two digit month and <code class="code-font">DD</code> is the two digit day. This is a good filename as it allows the files to easily be ordered by name and date.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Only files with the following extensions are allowed, <code class="code-font">pdf doc txt gpx gif png jpg jpeg gpx</code></li>
      <li>Note that there is a directory under <code class="code-font">root</code> &rarr; <code class="code-font">users</code>. The directory name starts with a '<code class="code-font">u</code>'. This is a directory that only you can see. You can upload files here but they cannot be shared with others. This directory will not be addressed in this document. Additional information about it can be found by talking with your local webmaster.
        <ul>
          <li>By default, this is the directory selected when you first log in. Be sure and follow the instructions below to upload into the correct, working directory.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <li>This tutorial covers creating a new subdirectory, uploading a document and updating the road capt'n forms, docs and procedure links. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section;

          <li>Referencing the image below, you can see it was successful by the <b>unlink</b> icon being grayed out and the title to the document is no longer underlined, which means it is no longer a link. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/rcUpdate05.jpg" alt="screenshot showing title unlinked"></li>
