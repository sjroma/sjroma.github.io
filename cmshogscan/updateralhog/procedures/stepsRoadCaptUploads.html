    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will also help with any questions you may have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please use caution when in the directories. You have the ability to delete files. This should <b>never</b> be done.</li>
      <li>Files being uploaded should include a datestamp. This is how we distinguish the latest file to be used.
        <ul>
          <li>For instance, <code>titleOfYourFile_YYYYMMDD.pdf</code> where <code>YYYY</code> is the four digit year, <code>MM</code> is the two digit month and <code>DD</code> is the two digit day. This is a good filename as it allows the files to easily be ordered by name and date.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Note that there is a directory under <code>root --> users</code>. The directory name starts with a '<code>u</code>'. This is a directory that only you can see. You can upload files here but they cannot be shared with others. This directory will not be addressed in this document. Additional information about it can be found by talking with your local webmaster.
        <ul>
          <li>By default, this is the directory selected when you first log in. Be sure and follow the instructions below to upload into the correct, working directory.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

        <span class="newline">Note, we only edit the links for <b>Raleigh NC Chapter</b>.
