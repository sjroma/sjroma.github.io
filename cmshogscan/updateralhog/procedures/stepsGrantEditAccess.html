    <ul>
      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>
          <li>The <i>production environment</i> is the site that all members see. This is where you make the changes that chapter members see. Our production environment is https://www.raleighhog.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.
        <ul>
          <li>Your login credentials are the same for both environments</li>
          <li>Your webmaster will help with any questions you may have</li>

    <p>Not every Primary or Discretionary Officer needs, or wants, a HOGScan role that allows them to edit pages or allows them to make changes to the website that could potentially damage the webite. Or, you may have a member that does not have a HOGScan role but needs to be able to view and/or edit a page that is only viewed by someone with a role or, can only be edited by someone with a role. For instance;
      <span class="newline"> - Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role assigned may have a need to see and/or update the Chapter Officers <i>Forms &amp; Documents</i> page. View and/or Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The Head Road Captain (HRC) needs to update a Road Captains <i>Forms, Documents &amp; Procedures</i> page that is only viewable by Road Captains. Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The chapter scribe needs to update a <i>Meeting Minutes</i> page or the Treasurer needs to update a <i>Financial Reports</i> page. Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
    </p>

    <p>This tutorial is divided into two sections. The HRC, Scribe and Treasurer can already see the pages they need to update. For them, you only need follow the steps in the Grant Update Access section. For the Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role you will need to follow the steps in both sections, Grant Update Access and Grant View Access. Click the respective link to jump to a specific section.

    <h2>Grant Update Access</h2>

    <p>To grant access you use the members Username. By default, Username is the members HOG ID. It is a best practice to have the member edit this field and put in their name as you will not remember what HOG ID matches which member in six months.
      <span class="newline">Members can use the Username to log in. It can be firstname, firstnamelastname, firstinitiallastname, etc. The system already knows and remembers the members email address so Username should not be the members email address.</span>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Referencing the image below, after logging into your website and navigating to the page for which you want to grant Update access, click the <b>Access control</b> tab. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1a.jpg" alt="screenshot showing access control tab"></li>
      <li>Referencing the image below, in the page that opens, scroll down to the <b>USER ACCESS CONTROL LISTS</b> section.
        <span class="newline">(I closed the 'Role Based Access Control Settings' section to make it easier to see the 'User Access Control Lists' section in the screenshot.)</span> <img class="screenshots" src="../images/accessUpdate1b.jpg" alt="screenshot showing user access control lists section">
      </li>
      <li>Referencing the image below, there are three Grant Access lists to expand. For this section of the tutorial, expand the <b>Grant Update Access</b> section by single clicking anywhere on the words. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1c.jpg" alt="screenshot showing grant edit access section expanded">
        <ol>
          <li>Referencing the image below, in the <b>Add user</b> box enter the members username.
            <span class="newline">As you type in the member's username a dropdown of matching names will appear. Select the appropriate one and it will appear in the box.</span> <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1d.jpg" alt="screenshot showing username field">
          </li>
          <li>Referencing the image below, click the <b>Add User</b> button and the members username will show in <b>Current users</b>.
            <span class="newline">If needed, additional usernames may be added by repeating steps <b class="number-reuse">3.1</b> and <b class="number-reuse">3.2</b>.</span>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1e.jpg" alt="screenshot showing username added">
          </li>
          <li>Referencing the image below, click the <b>Submit</b> button when all usernames have been added. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1f.jpg" alt="screenshot showing location of submit button"></li>
          <li>Referencing the image below, you will see a message that changes have been saved. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1g.jpg" alt="screenshot showing success message"></li>
          <li>I have not had to click the "rebuild permissions" link. Your mileage may vary. If you do click the link you will see the following screen. Either click the <b>Rebuild permissions</b> button and wait until it finishes or click "Cancel" to leave the page. <img class="screenshot" src="../images/accessUpdate1h.jpg" alt="screenshot of rebuild permissions page"></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Be sure to share the appropriate tutorial with the member so they can do updates properly. Let them know about the sandbox environment so they can try out the steps in the tutorial and see if they have any questions.</li>
