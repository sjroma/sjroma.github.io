      <li>There are two environments in which you can work;
        <ul>
          <li>The <i>sandbox environment</i> is where you can test and try things out to familiarize yourself with the steps you will be going through. The sandbox environment starts with <i>dev</i>. Our sandbox environment is https://dev.raleighhog.com</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note that prior to doing anything in the production environment you can <a href="https://dev.raleighhog.com" target="_blank">test in the sandbox environment</a> first. This environment is used for testing and is not seen by members.

    <p>Not every Primary or Discretionary Officer needs, or wants, a HOGScan role that allows them to edit pages or allows them to make changes to the website that could potentially damage the webite. Or, you may have a member that does not have a HOGScan role but needs to be able to view and/or edit a page that is only viewed by someone with a role or, can only be edited by someone with a role. For instance;
      <span class="newline"> - Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role assigned may have a need to see and/or update the Chapter Officers <i>Forms &amp; Documents</i> page. View and/or Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The Head Road Captain (HRC) needs to update a Road Captains <i>Forms, Documents &amp; Procedures</i> page that is only viewable by Road Captains. Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The chapter scribe needs to update a <i>Meeting Minutes</i> page or the Treasurer needs to update a <i>Financial Reports</i> page. Edit access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
    </p>

    <p>This tutorial is divided into two sections. The HRC, Scribe and Treasurer can already see the pages they need to edit. For them, you only need follow the steps in the Grant Edit Access section. For the Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role you will need to follow the steps in both sections, Grant Edit Access and Grant View Access. Click the respective link to jump to a specific section.
