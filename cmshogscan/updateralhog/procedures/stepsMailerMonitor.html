      <li>This environment is different than the website. There is only one, shared, account that is used for logging in. Do NOT change the Email or the Password.</li>
      <li>In this tutorial the Navagational Bar is referred to as the navbar.
        <ul>
          <li>Every website has a navbar. It normally appears at the top of the page or on the left side of the page. As a user clicks links in the navbar to go to different pages within the website, the navbar retains its position making it easy for the user to navigate to other pages within the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This tutorial covers monitoring a campaign and restoring a user that unsubscribed. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section;
