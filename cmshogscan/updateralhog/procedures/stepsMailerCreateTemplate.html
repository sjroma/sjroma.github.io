  <h1>HOG[SCAN] Mailer</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <h2>General notes, terminology and policies</h2>
    <p>Raleigh HOG uses the mailer to periodically send campaigns to our members. Generally the campaigns we send are;
      <span class="li">Newsletter announce - sent once a month when the newsletter is published</span>
      <span class="li">Monthly meeting reminder - sent once a month on the Monday before the Thursday meeting</span>
      <span class="li">LoH Monthly meeting reminder - sent once a month on the Monday before the Thursday meeting</span>
      <span class="li">Weekly ride reminder, aka Upcoming events - sent each Wednesday for the upcoming weekend ride(s) and/or events</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This environment is different than the website. There is only one, shared, account that is used for logging in. Do NOT change the Email or the Password.</li>
      <li>For the purposes of this tutorial, a campaign is what was previously called an 'email blast'.</li>
      <li>In this tutorial the Navagational Bar is referred to as the navbar.
        <ul>
          <li>Every website has a navbar. It normally appears at the top of the page or on the left side of the page. As a user clicks links in the navbar to go to different pages within the website, the navbar retains its position making it easy for the user to navigate to other pages within the website.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Please note, although certain steps may be specific to the Raleigh NC Chapter website, the overall steps should be generic enough that other chapters using <i>HOG[SCAN]</i> can follow along with only slight modifications.</li>
      <li>This tutorial covers creating your first template and copying an existing template. You can click the respective link to jump to a specific section;
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#create">Initial Template Creation</a></li>
          <li><a href="#template-copy">Copy an Existing Template</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  
  <article id="create" class="article-style">
    <h2>Initial Template Creation</h2>
    <p>This tutorial assumes you are new and need to create your first template. 
    <span class="newline">If you have a template in place and need to copy it to make another, click the link to <a href="#template-copy">go to the <b>Copy an Existing Template</b></a> section.</span>
    <span class="newline">If you have templates in place and need to update them, <a href="https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsHogscanMailer.html#template" target="_blank">go to the <b>Update an Existing Template</b> tutorial</a>.</span></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the link to <a href="https://mailer.hogscan.com/login" target="_blank">login to the HOG[SCAN] Mailer</a> see image below <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailer1.jpg" alt="sceenshot of login screen"></image></li>
      <li>After a successful login you will see the navbar on the left listing all that can be done with the HOG[SCAN] Mailer. This tutorial is only concerned with <b>Campaigns</b> and <b>Templates</b>. Everything else is out of scope for this tutorial.  see image below <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailer2.jpg" alt="sceenshot of navbar and campaigns link location"></image></li>
      <li>Click the down carat next to <b>Campaigns</b> to expand it, then select <b>Templates</b>. 
      <span class="newline">On the <b>Templates</b> page, click the <b>Gallery</b> tab to see two default templates. see image below</span> <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailer3b.jpg" alt="sceenshot of templates gallery page"></image></li>
      <li>Click to choose the default template, Dark or Light, that matches your website.</li>
      <li><span class="warning">Important note; When editing any template ensure that all changes are saved prior to leaving the page.</span> This is shown at the top of the template when editing.
      <span class="newline">Ensure that this; <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerSaving.jpg"></image></span>
      <span class="newline">Has changed to this; <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerSaved.jpg"></image></span>
      <span class="newline">prior to clicking any other link and leaving the page.</span></li>
      <li>For the purpose of this tutorial, the Dark template was chosen.
      <span class="newline">The top section mimics your website's navbar. We will edit it to match.  see image below</span> <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerDefaultTemplate1.jpg" alt="sceenshot of default dark template"></image></li>
      <li>Click where it says 'Your Chapter Name #1234' and put in your chapter's name and number as it appears on your website. Do the same for 'Your City, State'  see image below <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerDefaultTemplate2.jpg" alt="sceenshot of default dark template showing partial editing"></image></li>
      <li>We need to provide links in this navbar section that will take the member to the appropriate page.
      <span class="newline">When 'Home' is clicked a ribbon opens. Click on the link icon in the ribbon to edit.  see image below</span>  see image below<image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerDefaultTemplate3.jpg" alt="sceenshot of template editing navbar"></image></li>
      <li>You will see the following pop-up. Edit only the 'Link' by filling in your website's address. Note, change 'http' to 'https' as all HOGScan sites use the secure protocol.
      <span class="newline">Click the <b>Insert link</b> button to save.  see image below</span> <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerDefaultTemplate4a.jpg" alt="sceenshot of pop-up for navbar home link"></image></li>
      <li>The pop-up for the 'About' link (and each of the other links in the navbar) will be edited the same. However, note that you only edit "yourdomain.com" and change the protocol from http to https. Leave the forward slash (/) and whatever appears after it.  see image below <image class="screenshot" src="../images/mailerDefaultTemplate4b.jpg" alt="sceenshot of pop-up for navbar about link"></image></li>
      <li>You can then follow the instructions in the remaining sections to edit the template for your needs.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to anticipate how different chapters will want to use the mailer. If you have any questions please, <a href="mailto:webmaster@raleighhog.com">do not hesitate to contact me</a>. I can set up a Zoom meeting where screens can be shared to help you set up templates to meet your needs.</li>
