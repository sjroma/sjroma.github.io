  <h1>Grant Update / View Access</h1>

  <article class="article-style">
    <p>Not every Primary or Discretionary Officer needs, or wants, a HOGScan role that allows them to edit pages or allows them to make changes to the website that could potentially damage the webite. Or, you may have a member that does not have a HOGScan role but needs to be able to view and/or update a page that is only viewed by someone with a role or, can only be updated by someone with a role. For instance;
      <span class="newline"> - Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role assigned may have a need to see and/or update the Chapter Officers <i>Forms &amp; Documents</i> page. View and/or Update access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The Head Road Captain (HRC) needs to update a Road Captains <i>Forms, Documents &amp; Procedures</i> page that is only viewable by Road Captains. Update access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
      <span class="newline"> - The chapter scribe needs to update a <i>Meeting Minutes</i> page or the Treasurer needs to update a <i>Financial Reports</i> page. Update access can be granted on an individual basis without assigning a role.</span>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>This tutorial is divided into two sections. The HRC, Scribe and Treasurer can already see the pages they need to update. For them, you only need follow the steps in the Grant Update Access section. For the Primary Officers that do not have a HOGScan role you will need to follow the steps in both sections, Grant Update Access and Grant View Access. Click the respective link to jump to a specific section.

    <h2>Grant Update Access</h2>

    <p>To grant access, you need to use the members Username. By default, the Username field is set to the members HOG ID. It is a best practice to have the member edit their profile and change this field putting in their name as you will not remember what HOG ID matches which member in six months.
      <span class="newline">Members can use the Username to log in. It can be firstname, firstnamelastname, firstinitiallastname, etc. The system already knows and remembers the members email address so Username should not be the members email address.</span>
    </p>

    <p>For this section in the tutorial, our recording secretary needs to add the meeting minutes to the Meeting Minutes page. This basic page was created by and for Raleigh HOG. When created it was set so that only authenticated (logged in) users can see the page. By default, the minimum role needed to update the page is the Editor role. As this is the only page the recording sec'y needs to update, assigning the Editor role would be overkill. All that is required is update access.</p>

    <p>For this section of the tutorial, the primary officers do not have the Primary Officer role, therefore they cannot see the <i>Chapter Officers Forms and Documents</i> page.
