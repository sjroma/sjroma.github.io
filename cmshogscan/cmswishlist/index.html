      <h1><i>HOG[SCAN]</i> Wishlist</h1>
      <section>
        <p>In no particular order these are some enhancements and fixes that webmasters using <i>HOG[SCAN]</i> would like to see incorporated</p>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Show member mileage for Ride 365</dt>
          <dd>- Currently on the member's page one can only see mileage for 2018, 2019 and 2020
            <span class="newline">Members want to see mileage for 2021 as well as the running total for 2022 (the current year). Members always want to see the current year as well as possibly two or three years back.</span>
          </dd>

          <dt>Upgrade to use a better campaign emailer</dt>
          <dd>- Webmasters are aware there will be an improvement in <i>HOG[SCAN]</i> V2.0 with an alternative to Elastic Email
            <span class="newline">On the list because it's something everyone is anticipating</span>
          </dd>
          
          <dt>Leave user's on the same page when logging out rather than sending them to the home page each time</dt>
          <dd>- Currently when a user logs out they are thrown back to the home page rather than leaving them on the page they were currently viewing. When viewing the calendar and logging out, stay on the calendar page. If viewing newsletters, leave them on the default newsletter page that says "You must be logged in to view our Newsletters." In other words, it should manage state.</dd>
          
          <dt>Show Ride Milage on the event page if the field is non-zero</dt>
          <dd>Currently the Ride Milage is not shown in the copy of the event if it's been filled in. If the Ride Milage field for an event has been filled in (i.e. it's not the default of zero) then show the milage in the event copy. Much like an Event Coordinator is shown when that field has been filled in.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>Bugs</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Unable to download/view the <i>Chapter Charter</i> or <i>Chapter Handbook</i> when clicking the respective links.</dt>
          <dd>On the <code>About</code> page, clicking the link to download the <i>Chapter Charter</i> or <i>Chapter Handbook</i> fails. End user's see "This site can't be reached" message. This is because the code repeats the <code>https</code> protocol for each link.</dd>
          <dd>Webmasters, until there is an official fix, edit the 'About Us' page. Change the 'Text format' to 'HTML Code' and scroll down to the <i>Chapter Charter &amp; Handbook</i> section. The start of the section looks like this: <code>&lt;strong&gt;Chapter Charter &amp;amp; Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;</code></dd>
          <dd>Within that section change the following line</dd>
          <dd><code>&lt;a href="https://[hogscan:charter-url]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;</code></dd>
          <dd>to</dd>
          <dd><code>&lt;a href="[hogscan:charter-url]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;</code></dd>
          <dd>Do the same with the link to the <i>Chapter Handbook</i>. That is, delete <code>https://</code></dd>
          <dd>Be sure to scroll down and Save your changes</dd>
          <dt>Fix the GPX mapping feature on the event page</dt>
          <dd>- Seems to have stopped working around the same time the H-D Ride Planner altered how it gens a GPX file</dd>
