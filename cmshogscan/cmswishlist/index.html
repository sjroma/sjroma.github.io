      <h2>Defects</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Unable to download/view the <i>Chapter Charter</i> or <i>Chapter Handbook</i> when clicking the respective links.</dt>
        <dd>- On the <code>About</code> page, clicking the link to download the <i>Chapter Charter</i> or <i>Chapter Handbook</i> fails. End user's see "This site can't be reached" message. This is because the code repeats the <code>https</code> protocol for each link.
          <span class="newline">Webmasters, until there is an official fix, edit the 'About Us' page. Change the 'Text format' to 'HTML Code' and scroll down to the <i>Chapter Charter &amp; Handbook</i> section. The start of the section looks like this: <code>&lt;strong&gt;Chapter Charter &amp;amp; Handbook&lt;/strong&gt;</code></span>
          <span class="newline">Within that section change the following line</span>
          <span class="newline"><code>&lt;a href="https://[hogscan:charter-url]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;</code></span>
          <span class="newline">to</span>
          <span class="newline"><code>&lt;a href="[hogscan:charter-url]" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;</code></span>
          <span class="newline">Do the same with the link to the <i>Chapter Handbook</i>. That is, delete <code>https://</code></span>
          <span class="newline">Be sure to scroll down and Save your changes</span>
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Editor role cannot control access on new Basic page</dt>
        <dd>The editor role is able to create a basic page. By default a basic page can be seen by everyone. If the new page should only be seen by authenticated users the editor cannot make the change, they do not see the Access Control tab.</dd>
        <dd>Since the editor role is able to create a basic page they should have the ability to control access to that page.</dd>

        <dt>The smartphone app exposes member information to Road Captains</dt>
        <dd>The smartphone app should not expose member's HOG ID or ICE information to Road Captains. The app is the only place where member's private info is exposed to the Road Captain role.</dd>

        <dt>Fix the GPX mapping feature on the event page</dt>
        <dd>Seems to have stopped working around the same time the H-D Ride Planner altered how it gens a GPX file</dd>

        <dt><s>Global token for Chapter Handbook needs to be updated</s></dt>
        <dd>closed issue as fixed on 22 Dec 2022. National has updated the link on Chapter Resources, the global token points there.</dd>

        <dt><s>Mailer link points to an out of date URL</s></dt>
        <dd>closed issue as fixed on 26 Dec 2022. National has updated the link on Chapter Resources, the global token points there.</dd>

        <dt><s>Global token for member release form needs to be updated</s></dt>
        <dd>closed issue as fixed on 27 Jan 2023. The link has updated and the user is brought to the HogScan Mailer.</dd>

        <dt><s>Hidden page has an outdated column</s></dt>
        <dd>closed issue as will not fix on 31 Jan 2023. I figured out how to configure the column to show the current year.</dd>

        <dt><s>Show member mileage for Ride 365</s></dt>
        <dd>closed issue as fixed on 2 Feb 2023. Members can see Ride 365 mileage, including running total for the current year, by clicking 'My account' in the navbar</dd>

    <section class="enhancement">
      <h2>Enhancements</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Upgrade to use a better campaign emailer</dt>
        <dd>Webmasters are aware there will be an improvement in <i>HOG[SCAN]</i> V2.0 with an alternative to Elastic Email</dd>
        <dd>On the list because it's something everyone is anticipating</dd>

        <dt>Show Ride Mileage on the event page if the field is non-zero</dt>
        <dd>Currently the Ride Mileage is not shown in the copy of the event if it's been filled in.</dd>
        <dd>If the Ride Mileage field for an event has been filled in (i.e. it's not the default of zero) then show the mileage in the event copy. Much like an Event Coordinator is shown when that field has been filled in.</dd>

        <dt>Give webmasters the ability to sync the sandbox environment with the production environment</dt>
        <dd>Currently a request has to be made to the Admin in order to have the sandbox environment synced up with the production environment.</dd>
        <dd>It would be better if webmaster's had a button to click that would run the job to sync the sandbox with production so it could be done on-demand.</dd>

        <dt>Leave user's on the same page when logging out rather than sending them to the home page each time</dt>
        <dd>Currently when a user logs out they are thrown back to the home page rather than leaving them on the page they were currently viewing.</dd>
        <dd>When viewing the calendar and logging out, stay on the calendar page. If viewing newsletters, leave them on the default newsletter page that says "You must be logged in to view our Newsletters." In other words, it should manage state.</dd>
