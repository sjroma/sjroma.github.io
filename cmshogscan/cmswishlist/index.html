        <p>In no particular order these are some features/fixes webmasters using HOG[SCAN] would like to see incorporated</p>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Member Mileage for Ride 365</dt>
          <dd>- Currently on the member's page they can see mileage for 2018, 2019 and 2020
            <span class="newline">Members want to see mileage for 2021 as well as the running total for 2022 (will always want to see the current year as well as possibly two or three years back)</span>
          </dd>

          <dt>A better campaign emailer</dt>
          <dd>- Webmasters are aware there will be an improvement in HOG[SCAN] V2.0 with an alternative to Elastic Email
            <span class="newline">On the list because it's something everyone is anticipating</span>
          </dd>

        <h2>Bugs</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>A fix for the GPX mapping feature on the event page</dt>
          <dd>- Seems to have stopped working around the same time the H-D Ride Planner altered how it gens a GPX file</dd>

      <p>Webmasters, is there something you would like to see included in this list? <a href="mailto:webmaster@raleighhog.com">Send me an email</a> and I'll place it here.</p>
      <p>Please, be descriptive. What do you see versus what do you want to see.
