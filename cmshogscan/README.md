# README  

[HOG\[SCAN\]](https://www.hogscan.com) is a content management system (CMS) designed to help HOG chapters set up a responsive, easy to maintain website.  
The pages here started off as notes to myself and to share with team members but I'm going to open this up to any chapter that uses HOG\[SCAN\] in the hopes that they will help someone else.  

Other webmasters, if you have something you would like to see added here, have something to contribute, or would like to ask me a question please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:webmaster@raleighhog.com).

**[HOG chapters powered by HOG\[SCAN\]](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/chapters/)** - Alphabetized by state and then city, this page lists the HOG chapters that use HOG\[SCAN\] and provides a link to each one.  

**[HOG\[SCAN\] Setup Notes](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/cmswebsite/)** - HOG\[SCAN\] uses role based permissions to restrict network access based on a members role. This page gives a brief description of the various roles and the access granted to each one.  
Additionally the page also contains notes of things I've learned along the way.  

The following pages were created to help ease the transition for someone moving into a new role. They are step-by-step how-to guides that can be used by a first timer as well as provide a reference for those with more experience.  
  * **[Place a Newsletter on the Website](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsNewslettersUpdate.html)** - Editor role  
  * **[Place a Financial Report on the Website](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsFinancialReport.html)** - Editor role (page created by/for Raleigh NC Chapter)     
  * **[Update the Event Calendar](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsEventCalUpdate.html)** - Activities Officer role  
  * **[Upload Images to the Galleries page](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsGalleriesAdd.html)** - Photographer role  
  * **[Upload Road Captain Documents](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/updateralhog/procedures/stepsRoadCaptUploads.html)** - Road Captain role  
  * **[Using the HOG\[SCAN\] smartphone application](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/hogscanapp/index.html)** - Road Captain role  

The following pages were created from scratch for the raleighhog.com website. I have a background writing code with HTML and CSS so it's easier for me to create a page off-line and then copy/paste it to the CMS site.  
The pages here are shown as examples of what you can do to personalize your website.  
  * **[HOG Member of the Year](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/pagesralhog/hmoy)** - an award unique to the Raleigh NC Chapter. It is a list of chapter members who were selected for this honor each year since its inception in 2004. I tried to make it look like a plaque and give a 3D lighting effect to each name badge.  

  * **[Merchandise](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/pagesralhog/merchandise)** - a page showing available chapter merchandise. The page also shows if an item is out of stock or low stock. Hovering over an image causes it to grow.  
  There is no JavaScript behind this page. If an item is low, or out of stock, the page has to be manually updated.  
  
  * **[Patch Rides](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/pagesralhog/patchrides)** - a page showing various patches Raleigh NC Chapter members can earn by doing what everyone loves...riding. The page was styled using Flexbox to make it easier to add additional patch images along with the title and description. The description of each patch ride includes a link to a PDF which has the requirements to be met to earn the patch.  
  
  * **[FAQ](https://www.raleighhog.com/faq)** and **[Ladies of Harley](https://www.raleighhog.com/ladies-harley)** - both pages are simplistic in that there is not much coding that I did when creating them. However, the FAQ page uses the HTML description list rather than an unordered or ordered list only because I think it works better for the page and doesn't require me to put additional tags around the question in order to make the text bold.  
  
The following page shows what other webmasters using the CMS website HOG\[SCAN\] want to see added as enhancements and, what has been reported as a potential bug. You are encouraged to email to add to the list.
  * **[HOG\[SCAN\] wishlist](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/cmswishlist)** - view requested enhancements and reported bugs
