# CMS HOG[SCAN]

## HOG[SCAN] - a CMS (Content Management System) website

## HOG Chapters
A page showing the [HOG chapters powered by HOGSCAN](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/chapters/) 

## Raleigh HOG pages  
The following pages were created from scratch for the raleighhog.com website. I have a background writing code with HTML and CSS so it's easier for me to create a page off-line and then copy/paste it to the CMS site.  
The pages here are shown as an example of what you can do to personalize your website.  
  * [HOG Member of the Year](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/pagesralhog/hmoy) is a page unique to the raleighhog.com website. It is a list of chapter members who were selected for this honor each year since its inception in 2004. I tried to make it like a plaque and give a 3D color effect to each badge. 

  * [Merchandise](https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan/pagesralhog/merchandise) is a page showing available chapter merchandise  
  The page also shows if an item is out of stock or low stock  
  Hovering over an image causes it to grow
