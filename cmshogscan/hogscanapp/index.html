  <h1 class="title">HogScan</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle">A Smartphone Application</h2>

  <main>
    <h3>The app explained</h3>
    <p>Thank you for volunteering to be a Road Captain for the Raleigh NC Chapter of HOG.</p>
    <p>As you know, any rider that is not a member of the Raleigh NC chapter has to sign a release form, or waiver, when participating in one of our chapter rides. Currently we rely on riders knowing if their membership is current or not. If not current, they may still go on the ride but they need to sign a waiver just like any other guest. Not everyone is aware that to be a member of a local chapter you have to be a current member of national. If your national membership expires, so does your local membership.</p>
    <p>We have an app that assists with this proccess. The apps name is HogScan and it is a smartphone application that Road Captains download onto their smartphone to ease the check-in process. There is a one time $0.99 charge for the app. It is not a requirement that you download and use it.</p>
    <p>When using the app to check-in members, if membership is not current you will see "(EXPIRED)" next to the member's name or their name my not be in the list. If you try and check-in an expired member there will be a pop-up saying "This member is not current" and you will not be able to check the person in by using the app. This person will need to sign a waiver</p>
    <p>NOTE: When using the app you can see member's HOG ID and ICE (In Case of Emergency) information. This information is private and is not to be shared with anyone, including other members.</p>

    <h3>Using the app</h3>
    <p>Download and install the app</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Android users can find the app on the Google Play Store (search for <i>hogscan</i>)</li>
      <li>iPhone users can find the app on the App Store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have not created an account on the website, you will need to do so. If you have any problem <a class="link" href="mailto:webmaster@raleighhog.com">send an email to the webmaster</a> for help resolving the issue.</p>

            <dd>When viewing the calendar, the flag icon is displayed next to the current event. In this screenshot, "Pre meeting social hour" is the current event.

          <p class="screenshot-info">The thumbs up icon shown in the calendar view means you have RSVP'd to that particular event on the website's Event Calendar.</p>

          <p class="screenshot-info">This screenshot shows a current event. Notice at the top the indication that says "CURRENT EVENT". This view shows those members who have RSVP'd to the event. If the member is at the event you can swipe left and check them in.
            <span class="newline">Note, a member may RSVP to an event and not show. In that case, you do not check them in.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="screenshot-info">Be aware that there can be only one Current Event at a time. While we very rarely have two events at the same time, some events such as the Social Hour and the Monthly Chapter Meeting have times that are close. Someone may be checking members into the Social Hour event which means that members cannot be checked into the Monthly Chapter Meeting event.</p>
          <p class="screenshot-info">The motorcycle icon to the left of a member's name identifies that member as a Road Captain.</p>
