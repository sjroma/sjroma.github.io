# README  
This is a repo that hosts some of the work I've done. It gives users an easy way to see my work without having to `clone` or `download` the specific repository.  

## Links:  
**[Generate Random Lottery Numbers](https://sjroma.github.io/lotterynumbers)** - a front-end JavaScript exercise that generates random numbers for playing the U.S. based _Mega Millions_ and _Powerball_ lottery games. Contains an Easter egg that shows the various ways to win and the odds of winning.  

**[Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-LIZARD-SPOCK](https://sjroma.github.io/rpsls)** v2.0 - a front-end JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this version the user chooses by clicking an icon and feedback is provided on the page.  

  * **[Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS](https://sjroma.github.io/rps)** v1.0 - a front-end JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this version the user is prompted with Alert pop-ups, makes their choice via the keyboard and feedback is provided with pop-ups.

**[Listen to Music](https://sjroma.github.io/soundcloud)** - a front-end JavaScript exercise that connects to the Soundcloud API and lets the user search for an Artist or song title and then play the result  

**[Round tuit](http://sjroma.github.io/roundtuit)** - a goofy web page to give motivation to procrastinators  

**[HOG websites](https://sjroma.github.io/HOGsites)** - simple page w/navbar dropdowns of HOG websites built with various content management systems (CMS), [HOG[SCAN]](https://www.hogscan.com), [Pinnacle Consulting](http://pin-consult.com), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) and [Wix](https://www.wix.com)  

**[RalHOG Patches](https://sjroma.github.io/patchesPage)** - Refactored the old page. Now using CSS Grid instead of a table to make it easier to add Patch image, title and description. I've made the links accessible and included the ability to toggle to dark mode. 

**[fccJavaScript](http://sjroma.github.io/fccjs)** - JavaScript code snippets I wanted to save for possible future reference. Users can either;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- open Dev Tools and view the console  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- or open the interactive page, input test cases and see results w/out having to open Dev Tools. This as an exercise I came up with to combine/grow my HTML, CSS and front-end JS skills. 

### To-do
[ ] Create a portfolio for this space to showcase these apps and see another example of work I can do  
[x] Create v2 of rock-paper-scissors. One that does not rely on Alert pop-ups and having the user type in their choice
