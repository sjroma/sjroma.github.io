# README  

This is a repo that hosts some of the work I've done. It gives users an easy way to see my
work without having to `clone` or `download` the repository.  

## Links:  

[Generate random lottery numbers](https://sjroma.github.io/lotterynumbers) - a Javascript
exercise that generates random numbers for playing the _Mega Millions_ and _Powerball_ lottery 
games  

[Play rock-paper-scissors](https://sjroma.github.io/rps) the first version - a Javascript
exercise where you play against the computer

[Listen to music](https://sjroma.github.io/soundcloud) - a front end Javascript exercise that
connects to the Soundcloud API and lets the user search for an Artist or song title and then
play the result  

### To-do  
- [ ] Create a portfolio for this space to showcase these apps and see another example of work
I can do  
- [ ] Create v2 of rock-paper-scissors. One that does not rely on Alert pop-ups and having the user type in their choice
