# README  
This is a repo that hosts some of the work I've done. It gives users an easy way to see my work without having to `clone` or `download` the specific repository.  
## Links:  
**[Generate random lottery numbers](https://sjroma.github.io/lotterynumbers)** - a JavaScript exercise that generates random numbers for playing the U.S. based _Mega Millions_ and _Powerball_ lottery games. Contains an Easter egg that shows the various ways to win and the odds of winning.  
**[Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS](https://sjroma.github.io/rps)** the first version - a JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this iteration the user is prompted with Alert pop-ups, makes their choice via the keyboard and feedback is provided with pop-ups.  
**[Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-LIZARD-SPOCK](https://sjroma.github.io/rpsls)** - a JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this iteration the user chooses by clicking an icon and feedback is provided on the page.  
**[Listen to music](https://sjroma.github.io/soundcloud)** - a front end JavaScript exercise that connects to the Soundcloud API and lets the user search for an Artist or song title and then play the result.  
### To-do  
- [ ] Create a portfolio for this space to showcase these apps and see another example of work I can do  
- [x] Create v2 of rock-paper-scissors. One that does not rely on Alert pop-ups and having the user type in their choice
