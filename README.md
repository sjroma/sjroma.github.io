# What's here...
This repo hosts some work I've done. It gives users an easy way to see some of my work without having to `clone` or `download` a specific repository.  

## Links:  
<a href="https://sjroma.github.io/lotterynumbers" target="_blank">**Generate Random Lottery Numbers**</a> - a front-end JavaScript exercise that generates random numbers for playing the U.S. based _Mega Millions_ and _Powerball_ lottery games. Contains an Easter egg that shows the various ways to win and the odds of winning.  

<a href="https://sjroma.github.io/rpsls" target="_blank">**Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-LIZARD-SPOCK**</a> v2.0 - a front-end JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this version the user chooses by clicking an icon and feedback is provided on the page.  

  * <a href="https://sjroma.github.io/rps" target="_blank">**Play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS**</a> v1.0 - a front-end JavaScript exercise where you play rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock against the computer. In this version the user is prompted with Alert pop-ups, makes their choice via the keyboard and feedback is provided with pop-ups.  

<a href="https://sjroma.github.io/soundcloud" target="_blank">**Listen to Music**</a> - a front-end JavaScript exercise that connects to the Soundcloud API and lets the user search for an Artist or song title and then play the result  

<a href="http://sjroma.github.io/fccjs" target="_blank">**fccJavaScript**</a> - JavaScript code snippets I wanted to save for possible future reference. Users can either;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- open Dev Tools and view the console  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- or open the interactive page, input test cases and see results w/out having to open Dev Tools. This as an exercise I came up with to combine/grow my HTML, CSS and front-end JS skills.  

<a href="https://sjroma.github.io/cmshogscan" target="_blank">**cmshogscan**</a> - created as a way for me to share hints, tips and other information with webmasters that use HOG\[SCAN\], a content management system designed to help HOG chapters set up a responsive, easy to maintain website  

<a href="https://sjroma.github.io/HOGsites" target="_blank">**HOG chapter websites**</a> - simple page w/navbar dropdowns of HOG chapter websites that were built with various content management systems (CMS), such as <a href="https://www.hogscan.com" target="_blank">HOG[SCAN]</a>, <a href="http://pin-consult.com" target="_blank">Pinnacle Consulting</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com" target="_blank">Wix</a>  

<a href="http://sjroma.github.io/roundtuit" target="_blank">**Round TUIT**</a> - a goofy web page to give motivation to procrastinators  

### To-do  
  - [ ] Create a portfolio for this space to showcase these apps and see another example of work I can do   
  - [x] Create v2 of rock-paper-scissors. One that does not rely on Alert pop-ups and having the user type in their choice
