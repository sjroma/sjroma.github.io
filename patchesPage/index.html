  <h1>Uniquely Raleigh HOG Patches</h1>
  <h2 class="introduction">Raleigh HOG offers some great riding opportunities with our weekly group chapter rides. We also encourage our members to take off on their own and enjoy the great North Carolina highways and byways on their Harley-Davidson motorcycle. And why not earn a patch while doing both!</h2>

        <p class="ride-info">
          Raleigh H.O.G. created this patch to encourage chapter members to visit all 100 North Carolina counties while riding their Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Credit cannot be claimed for county visits prior to officially starting. Each member participating must maintain and present a completed log for a patch to be awarded to that member. Couples should maintain a separate log for both participants. <a class="link" href="pdf/NC100GuidelinesLogMap.pdf" target="_blank">Obtain a copy of the patch rules, a log for recording county visits and a map</a> to get started. Use the map to visually see what counties have been visited and to plan routes for counties to be visited.
