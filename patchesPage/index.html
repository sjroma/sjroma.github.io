        <p class="ride-info">
          Raleigh HOG created this patch to encourage chapter members to visit all 100 North Carolina counties while riding their Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Each participating member must maintain and present a completed log to be awarded the patch. Couples should maintain a separate log for both participants. <a class="link" href="pdf/NC100GuidelinesLogMap.pdf" target="_blank">Obtain a copy of the patch rules, a log for recording county visits and a map</a> to get started. Use the map to visually see what counties have been visited and to plan routes for counties to be visited. Credit cannot be claimed for county visits prior to officially starting.
