# Raleigh HOG Patches  

## View the [Raleigh HOG Patches](https://sjroma.github.io/patchesPage/index.html) page  

Refactored the old page  
  - Use Flexbox instead of a table making it easier to add a future `.patch-container` class which holds the patch image, title and ride description.  
  - Make [accessible links](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text) rather than having users click on the word "here".  
  - Make patch image backgrounds transparent  
  - Add templates for ease of updating PDF files and to make files look uniform  

Originally the refactored page had a toggle for light/dark mode. 
  - Was asked to remove light/dark mode toggle and present the page in dark mode only.
