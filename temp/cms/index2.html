    <h2>Assignable Roles</h2>
    <p>HOG[SCAN] uses "role based permissions" which restricts network access based on each members role within your HOG chapter. This allows you, the webmaster, to control what roles each officer and member has to the different levels of the system. For example, not every primary officer wants, or needs, the Primary Officer role.</p>
    <p>Remember, you have a sandbox (dev) environment to work in. Make changes in that environment first.</p>
    <p>Roles on this page are listed by permissions, highest to lowest.</p>
    <p>Please note that the Webmaster, Primary Officer and Membership Officer roles have access to member information. Assign these roles with caution.</p>

    <h2>Directories</h2>
    <p>Each assignable role also has read/write permission to a <code>users</code> directory. This directory is unique to each person, even those that share the same role.</p>
    <p>Use the read/write access to directories to your advantage. Do not just dump files or images into a directory. Rather, create subdirectories as needed. For instance, in the <code>activities</code> directory create a subdirectory to place images for destination rides and another subdirectory for images for dealer events. It's clear to you and to others what the directories are for.</p>
