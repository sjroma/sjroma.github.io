# Here's your round tuit 
I was just goofing around and this popped into my head so...   
Pass it around to anyone you know that's procrastinating  

This is the simplest of simple. Just an H1 title, a jpg of a poker chip with some text superimposed
on top with some styling to make it look like it's carved in and then the tuit poem.
