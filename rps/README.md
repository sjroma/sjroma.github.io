# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

## Click to [play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](https://sjroma.github.io/rpsls)

A front-end JavaScript exercise where the user plays Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) against the 
computer.  
RPS is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper or scissors. The
items are compared and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins. The possible outcomes are:    
* Scissors cuts paper  
* Paper covers rock  
* Rock crushes scissors
* If there's a tie, the game ends in a draw  
Write a function that will get the computer's choice from an array, read in the player's
choice and compare the two to determine a winner. Display the results using `console.log`.

And then RPS evolved to Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock  
> I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone 
> well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end 
> up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability.
