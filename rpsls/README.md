# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock  

A front-end JavaScript exercise where the user plays Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) against the
computer.  
RPS is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper or scissors. The
items are compared and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins. The possible
outcomes are:  
* Scissors cuts paper  
* Paper covers rock  
* Rock crushes scissors  
* If there's a tie, the game ends in a draw  
  
And then, RPS evolved to Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock  
> I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems that when you know someone  
> well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end  
> up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability.
